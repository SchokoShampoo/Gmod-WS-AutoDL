# Gmod-WS-AutoDL

This addon automatically forces a player to download a specific workshop-collection with all attached collections and their addons, when he connects to your server. So they don't need to wait forever if for the download.

## Installation
Just place the workshoploader in you addons folder start your server and enjoy the fast joining of your players.

If you want another collection for the players as the server uses just type the collection id in the workshop.txt in the workshop folder. You can also type more than one collection id in this file, just one per line.

When a "0" is in a line all following collections will be ignored and the server-addons will be loaded.


## Support
If you have wishes just open an issue and I will see if I can help you. ^^
